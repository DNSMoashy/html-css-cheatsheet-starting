        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language that is used in combination with HTML
         that customizes how HTML elements will appear.</p>
        <p>CSS code can be Inline style or a separate file.
          <ul>
            <li>CSS styles can be directly added to HTML elements by using the style attribute 
              in the elements opening tag. Each style declaration is ended with a semicolon.</li>
            <li>More commonly CSS gets its own file to make code easier to read/maintain. 
              The extension for CSS files is .css. These can be linked to an HTML file using a link
              tag in the head section.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>To connect an external CSS file to its html file you would use the link
          element within the head tag. Normally included within the link element is:
          <ol>
            <li>href attribute to specify the URL to the external resource</li>
            <li>rel attribute to specify the relationship of the linked document to the 
              current document</li>
            <li>type attribute to define the type of content being linked</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
        <p>Rulesets: A ruleset is defined within either the HTML document itself, or 
          in one or more separate files (known as stylesheets) that use the .css extension.</p>
        <p>Next in the ruleset syntax is the block of declarations between the two braces {...}. 
          This is the block of code that defines the style that will be applied. 
          This is equivalent to the style attribute value in the inline-style.</p>
        <p>The declaration block, or attribute value, is made up of one or more declarations. 
          A declaration is made up of a CSS property name, followed by a colon (color:) then a value, 
          followed by a semicolon, (blue;).</p>

        <h3>Selectors</h3>
        <p>CSS type selectors are used to match all elements of a given type or tag name. 
          When using type selectors, elements are matched regardless of their nesting level
          in the HTML.</p>
          <p>CSS can select elements by type, class, id, & attribute.</p>
        <p>Specificity used when there are multiple conflicting property values 
          that point to the same element. When determining which rule to apply, the selector with the
          highest specificity wins out. The most specific selector type is the ID selector, followed by
          class selectors, followed by type selectors.</p>
        <p>Pseudo-Class: Allows elements to have to different states, such as hover
          or before and after click. Can be attached to any selector.</p>
        <h3>How To Single Selector:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>*-Universal/All</li>
          <li>.classname-by class</li>
          <li>#idname-by ID</li>
          <li>element- type selector; all like elements (ex. all p)</li>
          <li>[attribute]-by attribute</li>
            <ul>
              <li>EX: img[src*='']</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Chain Multiple Selectors:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Descendant Selector: match elements that are descended from one another
            <ul>
              <li>EX: div p {}</li>
              <li>All p within div are selected. Parent THEN child/nested</li>
              <li>Denoted by single space between each selector and descended selector.</li>
              <li>All matching elements selected regardless of nesting.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Chaining Selectors: selecting elements who also have the same class/ID, etc..
            <ul>
              <li>EX: h3.section-heading {}</li>
              <li>All h3 elements with the class section-heading are selected.</li>
              <li>Element and then selector WITHOUT a space.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Grouping Selectors: Match multiple selectors to same CSS rule via comma
            <ul>
              <li>EX: h1, h2 {}</li>
              <li>Separated by comma then space.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
