        <h3>Positioning</h3>
        <p>Use the 5 values with offset properties (top, bottom, left, right)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Static: Default Value</li>
          <li>Absolute: All other elements on page ignore the element/act as if its not present</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The element will be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element.</li>
              <li>offset properties can be used to determine the final position from there.</li>
              <li>You can put wherever you need and scrolls with rest of document.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Sticky:Keeps element in document flow as user scrolls then sticks to specified position</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Similar to fixed until reaching specified position via offset properties</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Relative:position an element relative to its default static position on the web page.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>accompany with offset property to specify what it is relative to.</li>
              <li>EX. top:50px will move the box 50px from the top of its static position.</li>
              <li>This does not affect positioning of other elements.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Fixed:Fixes to specific position</li>
            <ul>
              <li>fixes an element to a specific position on the page (regardless of user scrolling)</li>
              <li>Often used for navigation bars.</li>
              <li>Accompany with offset properties.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <section id="z-index">
          <h3>Z-Index</h3>
          <p>controls how far back or how far forward an element should appear on the web page when 
          elements overlap. This can be thought of as the depth of elements, with deeper elements
          appearing behind shallower elements.</p>
          <p>Accepts integer values 0-1. This instructs browser on the order elements should be
          layered.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Default is 0</li>
            <li>closer to 1 the more shallow/in front</li>
            <li>closer to 0 the deeper/behind a block becomes</li>
            <li>use with position and offset properties</li>
            <li>does NOT work on static</li>

        <h3>Display</h3>
        <p>Every HTML element has a default display value that dictates if it can share horizontal
          space with other elements. Some elements fill the entire browser from left to right 
          regardless of the size of their content. Other elements only take up as much horizontal 
          space as their content requires and can be directly next to other elements.</p>
        <p>Has three values: inline, block, inline-block.</p>
        <h3>Other Properties</h3>
        <h4>Float:</h4>
        <p>moving an element as far left or as far right as possible in the container, you can
           use the float property. Must have width specified.</p>
        <p>commonly used for wrapping text around an image. (reg CSS not best use of this)</p>
        <p>when multiple floated elements have different heights, it can affect their layout on
           the page. Specifically, elements can “bump” into each other and not allow other elements to properly move to the left or right.</p>
        <h4>Clear:</h4>
        <p>The clear property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on
           the page. It can take on one of the following values:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>left—the left side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.</li>
          <li>right—the right side of the element will not touch any other element within the same containing element.</li>
          <li>both—neither side of the element will touch any other element within the same containing element.</li>
          <li>none—the element can touch either side.</li>
        </ol>
        <section id="inline">
          <h4>Inline</h4>
          <p>Inline is the default display for some elements such as em and strong.</p>
          <p>Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up 
            the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line
            after each element. </p>
          <p>inline elements cannot be altered in size with the height or width CSS properties.</p>
          <p>displays its content on the same line as the content surrounding it, including the anchor tag.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="block">
          <h3>Display:Block</h3>
          <p>not displayed in the same line as the content around them. </p>
          <p>These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, width property can also be 
            set. Unless otherwise specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their
            content. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="inlineblock">
          <h3>Inline-Block</h3>
          <p>combines features of both inline and block elements</p>
          <p>can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width
            and height properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block elements.</p>
