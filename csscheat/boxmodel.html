        <h3>The Box Model</h3>
        <p>The Box Model is a CSS layout mechanism that the web browser
           uses to render content organized by box-shaped elements. Each element is made of four 
           specific areas.</p>
        <img src="../assets/Boxmodell-detail.png" height="500" width="500">
        <p>Browsers load HTML elements with default position values. 
          All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as “living” inside of a box. 
          This is what is meant by the box model.
        </p>
        <h4>Height & Width</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>An element’s content has two dimensions: a height and a width.</li>
          <li>By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the raw contents of the box.</li>
          <li>The CSS height and width properties can be used to modify these default dimensions.</li>
          <li> When the width and height of an element are set in pixels, it will be the same size on all devices
             — an element that fills a laptop screen will overflow a mobile screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Box Sizing</h4>
        <p>allows us to include the padding and boarder in the calculation of an element’s height and width</p>
        <p>Has 2 values:</p>
        <p>border-box: Any assigned padding or border is included in the calculation of an elements height or width.</p>
        <p>content-box: Default CSS behavior, the assigned height or width of an element plus any padding will be the total height or weight.</p>
        <section id="content">
          <h3>Content:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Content Area:
              <ul>
                <li>This area contains the actual content of an element, including text and images.
                It also sometimes has a background-color or background-image</li>
                <li>width and height: The width and height of the content area.</li>
                <li>Can be set in px or %.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="padding">
          <h3>Padding:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Padding Area:
                <ul>
                  <li>This area is located between the content and border areas. It can be changed on 
                  the top, right, bottom and left sides.</li>
                  <li>The amount of space between the content area and the border.</li>
                  <li> Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p>The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding. 
          Padding is like the space between a picture and the frame surrounding it.</p>
          <p>The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make the
             content look less cramped.</p>
          <p>In CSS, you can modify this space with the padding property.</p>
          <div class="shorthand">
            <h4>Padding Shorthand:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>4 values: top, right, bottom, left.</li>
              <li>3 values: top, left & right when equal, bottom.</li>
              <li>2 values: top & bottom, left & right.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="border">
          <h3>Border:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Border Area:
              <ul>
                <li>This area is located between the margin and padding areas. 
                Their thickness and style can be changed.</li>
                <li>Surrounds the content and padding areas.</li>
                <li>Properties can be set within one line of code or multiple.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting.
            Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color.
          </p>
          <p>The default border is medium none color, where color is the current color of
             the element. If width, style, or color are not set in the CSS file, the web browser assigns 
             the default value for that property.</p>
          <div class="radius">
            <h4>Border Radius</h4>
            <p>You can modify the corners of an element’s border box with the border-radius property.</p>
            <p>You can create a border that is a perfect circle by first creating an element with the same 
            width and height, and then setting the radius equal to half the width of the box, which is 50%.
            </p>
          </div>
        </section>
       
        <section id="margin">
          <h3>Margin:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Margin Area:
              <ul>
                <li>This is the outermost area in the Box Model. It borders with the margin areas
                 of neighboring elements</li>
                <li>It can be changed on the top, right, bottom and left sides.</li>
                <li>The amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. The margin property is used to 
            specify the size of this space.</p>
          <p>This means that other HTML elements on the page cannot come within however many pixels
            of the paragraphs border as set by the margin</p>
          <div class="shorthand">
            <h4>Margin Shorthand:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>4 values: top, right, bottom, left.</li>
              <li>3 values: top, left & right when equal, bottom.</li>
              <li>2 values: top & bottom, left & right.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div class="auto">
            <h4>Auto/Centering</h4>
            <p>The margin property also lets you center content. However, you must follow a few syntax 
            requirements. In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element.
            It’s not possible to center an element that takes up the full width of the page, since the
            width of the page can change due to display and/or browser window size.
            </p>
            <p>margin: 0 auto; will center the divs in their containing elements. The 0 sets the top and
             bottom margins to 0 pixels. The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and
             right margins until the element is centered within its containing element.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="collapse">
            <h4>Margin Collapse</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Horizantal(right & left):add the sum of margins</li>
              <li>Vertical(top & bottom):Larger margin sets/determines distance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              As you have seen, padding is space added inside an element’s border, while margin is 
              space added outside an element’s border. One additional difference is that top and
              bottom margins,also called vertical margins, collapse, while top and bottom padding 
              does not.</p>
            <p>Horizontal margins (left and right), like padding, are always displayed and added
              together. For example, if two divs with ids #div-one and #div-two, are next to each
              other, they will be as far apart as the sum of their adjacent margins.</p>
            <p>
              Unlike horizontal margins, vertical margins do not add. Instead, the larger
              of the two vertical margins sets the distance between adjacent elements.

        <h2>Box Model:Sizing</h2>
        <section id="wh">
          <p>Because a web page can be viewed through displays of differing screen size, the content
          on the web page can suffer from those changes in size. To avoid this problem, CSS offers
          two properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an element’s box can be sized to:</p>
          <p>Content, like text, can become difficult to read when a browser window is narrowed or
          expanded. These two properties ensure that content is legible by limiting the minimum 
          and maximum widths of an element.</p>
          <h4>Four Attributes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>min-width—this property ensures a minimum width of an element’s box.</li>
            <li>max-width—this property ensures a maximum width of an element’s box.</li>
            <li>min-height — this property ensures a minimum height for an element’s box.</li>
            <li>max-height — this property ensures a maximum height of an element’s box.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="overflow">
          <h3>Overflow</h3>
          <p>All of the components of the box model comprise an element’s size.</p>
          <h5>An Example of this:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An img comprised of the following dimensions: 364px wide by 244px tall
              <ul>
                <li>300 pixels wide</li>
                <li>200 pixels tall</li>
                <li>10 pixels padding on the left and right</li>
                <li>10 pixels padding on the top and bottom</li>
                <li>2 pixels border on the left and right</li>
                <li>2 pixels border on the top and bottom</li>
                <li>20 pixels margin on the left and right</li>
                <li>10 pixels margin on the top and bottom</li>
              </ul>
            <li>The total dimensions (364px by 244px) are calculated by adding all of
              the vertical dimensions together and all of the horizontal dimensions together. </li>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Sometimes, these components result in an element that is larger than the parent’s 
            containing area. This is where Overflow comes in so we can view all of an element.
          that is larger then its parent container.</p>
          <h5>Common Values</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>hidden—when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view.
            </li>
            <li>scroll—when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element’s box so that 
              the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.</li>
            <li>visible—when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the
               containing element. Note, this is the default value.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section id="default">
          <h3>Resetting Defaults</h3>
          <p>All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in the absence of an external
            stylesheet. These default stylesheets are known as user agent stylesheets. </p>
          <p>User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set default values for padding
            and margin. This affects how the browser displays HTML elements, which can make it 
            difficult for a developer to design or style a web page.</p>
          <p>To reset these values: * {} set both margin and padding rules to 0</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Visibility</h3>
          <p>Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property.
            The visibility property can be set to one of the following values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>hidden — hides an element.</li>
            <li>visible — displays an element.</li>
            <li>collapse — collapses an element.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>users can still view the contents of the list item (e.g., Donate) by viewing the source
            code in their browser. Furthermore, the web page will only hide the contents of the
            element. It will still leave an empty space where the element is intended to display.</p>
          <p>What’s the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden? An element with 
            display: none will be completely removed from the web page. An element with
             visibility: hidden, however, will not be visible on the web page, but the space 
             reserved for it will.</p>
