        <p>
          "Because the header of a page is part of the body of the page, just as the footer. 
          Think about this <body> as a human body: Head, middle of the body and the feet. 
          A page has the same concept: Header (is the head), section (middle of the body),
          and footer (the feet)."

      <h2>Basic Structure:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each HTML document can be considered a "Document Tree".</li>
        <li>HTML is organized into a family tree structure. Such as grand-parents,
          parents, children, siblings etc.</li>
        <li>Every HTML Document has the following in order:
          !DOCTYPE, html (opening & closing),head(O&C) & body (O&C) inside html.</li>
        <li>Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing body tags.</li>
        <li>Headings and sub-headings, h1 to h6 tags, are used to provide titles
           for sections of content.</li>
        <li>You can't wrap a block element with an inline element. 
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">Difference between the two.
          </a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Nesting:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. 
          The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.</li>
        <li>The relationship between elements and their ancestor 
          and descendent elements is known as hierarchy.</li>
        <li>Children are nested within parent are shown via a tab/2spaces of indentation
          for better readability.</li>
          <ol>
            <li>DOCTYPE and html are same nesting level,</li>
            <li>Head and body are the children of HTML but siblings to each other.
              They are on indented under head, but same nesting to each other. </li>
            <li>Elements such as main & footer go within body as a child element.</li>
            <li>Elements like div & footer can be both parents and children 
              depending on order/structure.</li>
          </ol>
        <li>There can be multiple levels of nesting thus extending to grand 
          and great grand children.</li>
        <li>SELF REMINDER: elements within elements are children,
            text within element does NOT need to be formatted as a child.
        </li>
        <li>SELF REMINDER: you don't need to add a space after a tag to write a sentence.
          YOu can just type immediatley after the >.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Semantics</h2>
      <!--As of 01/17/23 still cannot figure if anchor tag goes within a block element like p-->
      <a href="./elements.html">More semantics info here</a>
      <ul>
        <li>This adds meaning to our code, making it more accesible/easier to read.</li>
        <li>This can turn meaningless elements such as DIV ( a general purpose element)
          into one with meaning like main.</li>
        <li>This can be used to replace a div with a class as a self explanatory element.</li>
      </ul>
    </main>
